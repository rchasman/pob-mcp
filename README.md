# Path of Building MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables Claude to analyze, modify, and optimize Path of Building builds using PoB's actual calculation engine.

Works against a **stock [PathOfBuildingCommunity](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding) checkout** — no fork, no patches. The server ships its own stdio adapter that loads PoB's `HeadlessWrapper.lua` as a library and drives the real calculation engine directly.

> **PoE 3.29 compatibility:** This release targets Path of Building data and builds for the 3.29 league. Use a current PoB checkout for the matching tree, skills, and item data. Trade calls should always use `get_leagues` instead of hard-coding a challenge-league name.

## Installation

```bash
cd pob-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

**Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### XML-Only (No Lua Bridge)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/your/Path of Building/Builds"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### With the Lua Bridge

If PoB is installed (macOS), this is the whole configuration. `POB_PATH`, `POB_DIRECTORY`
and `POB_CMD` are detected from the installed app.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_LUA_ENABLED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `POB_PATH` explicitly only when driving a PathOfBuilding git checkout instead of an
installed app, or when the app lives somewhere unusual:

```json
        "POB_PATH": "/path/to/PathOfBuilding/src",
        "POB_CMD": "/opt/homebrew/bin/luajit"
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POB_DIRECTORY` | detected Builds dir | Path to your PoB builds directory |
| `POB_LUA_ENABLED` | `false` | Set `"true"` to enable Lua bridge |
| `POB_PATH` | installed PoB app, else `~/Projects/PathOfBuilding/src` | `src/` of a stock PathOfBuilding checkout. Usually unnecessary: an installed PoB is detected automatically (`POB_FORK_PATH` is a legacy alias) |
| `POB_CMD` | `luajit` | LuaJIT binary path |
| `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Lua request timeout (ms) |
| `POB_DEBUG` | `false` | Set `"true"` for verbose Lua bridge logging |
| `POB_ARGS` | (none) | Space-separated arguments passed to the Lua process (overrides the default adapter arguments) |
| `POE_TRADE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Trade API tools |
| `POE_SESSION_ID` | (none) | Your POESESSID cookie value; required for the `find_weighted_trade_items` tool |
| `POE_CACHE_TTL` | `300` | Trade API response cache TTL in seconds |
| `POE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND` | `4` | Trade API requests per second |

### Setting Up the Lua Bridge

The Lua bridge uses PoB's actual calculation engine for accurate stats.

#### If you already have Path of Building installed (macOS)

Install LuaJIT and you are done:

```bash
brew install luajit
```

The server locates the engine inside the installed app, so there is no checkout to clone
and no Lua modules to install. It uses the writable `src/` copy the app maintains under
`~/Library/Application Support/PathOfBuildingMac`, which means the engine always matches
the PoB you actually run, and the app's own C modules, which are the ones PoB ships no
non-Windows build of in the repo.

Skip to step 4 to verify.

#### Working from a PathOfBuilding checkout instead

#### 1. Install LuaJIT
```bash
# macOS
brew install luajit

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install luajit

# Windows: download from https://luajit.org/ and add to PATH
```

#### 2. Install PoB's Lua C modules (macOS and Linux)

PoB commits its C modules to `runtime/` as Windows `.dll` builds only, so a checkout
cannot supply them anywhere else. Without this the bridge appears to hang and then times
out, because PoB reports `module 'lua-utf8' not found` and waits for a keypress that
never comes.

```bash
luarocks --lua-version=5.1 --local install luautf8

# Homebrew LuaJIT needs to be pointed at explicitly:
luarocks --lua-version=5.1 --lua-dir=$(brew --prefix luajit) --local install luautf8
```

The bridge searches `~/.luarocks/lib/lua/5.1`, so `--local` is enough. Windows users can
skip this: the bundled DLLs are used.

#### 3. Clone PathOfBuilding
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding.git
```
Note the full path to the `src/` directory — that's your `POB_PATH`.

> No fork or patches are required. The server ships its own stdio adapter (`lua/vanilla_stdio_bridge.lua` + `lua/pob_ops.lua`) that loads the stock `HeadlessWrapper.lua` as a library and drives PoB's real calculation engine directly. Every Lua-bridge tool — stats, tree editing, gems, items, config, specs, save/export, anointments, weighted trade queries — works against an unmodified checkout. Call `lua_get_capabilities` at runtime for the authoritative action list.

To verify locally after building this project:

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

The smoke tests resolve the engine the same way the server does, so an installed
PoB needs no configuration. Set `POB_PATH` only to point them at a checkout.

This runs both the adapter contract and MCP stdio transport checks: tool discovery, capabilities, build load, snapshot, stats, items, skills, reversible tree mutation, config, anointment ranking, and build info.

For the deep end-to-end workflow suite:

```bash
npm run test:smoke:full
```

This verifies blank-build gem editing, build discovery and file persistence, loading, character-level mutation and restoration, tree search, build validation, configuration/snapshot save-and-restore, and defensive/boss-readiness analysis.

To exercise the live Trade API integration (requires network access):

```bash
npm run test:smoke:trade
```

This verifies MCP discovery plus live league, stat, item-search, price-check, resistance-gear recommendation, currency-rate, and trading-profit requests against the Standard league.

To also exercise the authenticated weighted BIS search (requires your `POESESSID`):

```bash
POE_SESSION_ID=<your POESESSID> npm run test:smoke:weighted
```

To verify live crafting-data integration (requires network access):

```bash
npm run test:smoke:crafting
```

This verifies that the crafting advisor obtains current currency rates and base-mod data for a known item base through MCP.

#### 4. Verify
```bash
luajit -v
ls /path/to/PathOfBuilding/src/HeadlessWrapper.lua
```

#### 5. Update Claude Desktop config and restart Claude Desktop

### Affixes & Crafting

Read straight out of the installed Path of Building's `Data/ModExplicit.lua` and
`Data/ModMaster.lua`, so no build needs to be loaded and the Lua bridge is not involved.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `classify_item_affixes` | Resolve mod lines to affixes: prefix/suffix counts, open slots, tiers, hybrids |
| `list_craftable_mods` | Bench crafts an item class can take at a given item level |
| `find_affix_tiers` | Every tier of a stat: type, minimum item level, value range, base tags |

A hybrid affix prints several lines, and counting those lines separately inverts the
answer: `Pixie's` is one prefix that prints both an energy shield roll and a stun and
block recovery roll. `classify_item_affixes` resolves the affix, not the lines.

**`suggest_optimal_nodes` goals**: `damage`, `defense`, `life`, `es`, `resist`, `speed`

**Defensive layers**:
- **Avoidance** — evasion, spell suppression, dodge, block
- **Mitigation** — armour/PDR, endurance charges
- **Recovery** — life regen (≥1%/s), leech, ES recharge

A build with all 3 layers is considered exceptional.

### Configuration & Enemy Settings

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|

| `save_config_preset` | Save current config as a named preset |
| `load_config_preset` | Load a saved config preset |
| `list_config_presets` | List all saved config presets |

### Build Validation

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `validate_build` | Check resistances, life, defensive layers, mana, immunities, accuracy, damage scaling |

Returns critical issues, warnings, and info with actionable suggestions and an overall 0–10 health score. Uses Lua bridge stats when available; falls back to XML parsing. `build_name` is optional — omitting it validates the currently loaded Lua bridge build.

### Skill Gem Analysis

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `analyze_skill_links` | Evaluate support gems and detect build archetype |
| `suggest_support_gems` | Ranked support gem recommendations with DPS estimates |
| `validate_gem_quality` | Find gems needing quality, awakened upgrades, or corruption |

| `save_tree` | Write passive tree back to an existing build file |
| `snapshot_build` | Create a versioned snapshot with description and tag |
| `list_snapshots` | List all snapshots for a build |
| `restore_snapshot` | Restore from a snapshot (auto-backs up current state) |
| `export_build_summary` | Export a human-readable build summary |

Snapshots are stored in `POB_DIRECTORY/.pob-mcp/snapshots/`.

**Note**: `export_build` copies from the XML file, not from the Lua bridge. Use `lua_save_build` first if you want to export in-memory changes.

### Currency & Market Data (poe.ninja)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_currency_rates` | Live exchange rates for all currencies (Chaos Orb equivalent) |
| `find_arbitrage` | Detect profitable currency trading loops |
| `calculate_trading_profit` | Evaluate a specific trading chain |

Rates are updated every 5 minutes from poe.ninja. Pass the **exact** league name (e.g., `Standard`, `Hardcore`, `Settlers`).

### Trade API Tools (Require `POE_TRADE_ENABLED=true`)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_trade_items` | Search trade with stat filters, price range, link count |
| `find_weighted_trade_items` | Build-specific BIS search via PoB's TradeQueryGenerator stat weights (requires `POE_SESSION_ID` and the Lua bridge) |

## Typical Workflows

### Analyze an existing build
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
3. lua_get_stats (category: "defense")
4. validate_build
5. analyze_defenses (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
```

### Build from scratch
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_new_build (class_name: "Witch", ascendancy: "Necromancer")
3. setup_skill_with_gems (active_gem: "Summon Skeletons", support_gems: [...])
4. lua_set_tree (nodes: [...])
5. lua_get_stats
6. lua_save_build (build_name: "MySummoner.xml")
```

### Optimize passive tree
```
1. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
2. suggest_optimal_nodes (goal: "life", points_available: 5)
3. search_tree_nodes (query: "maximum life")
4. lua_get_tree   ← copy current node list
5. lua_set_tree   ← add new nodes to the list
6. lua_get_stats  ← verify improvement
7. lua_save_build ← persist
```

### Test DPS against Shaper
```
1. lua_load_build
2. set_enemy_stats (level: 84, fire_resist: 40, cold_resist: 40, lightning_resist: 40)
3. set_config (config_name: "enemyIsBoss", value: true)
4. lua_get_stats (category: "offense")
```

### Find the best anointment and shop for upgrades
```
1. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
2. find_best_anointment (slot: "Amulet", focus: "both")
3. find_weighted_trade_items (league: "Standard", slot: "Amulet")   ← requires POE_TRADE_ENABLED + POE_SESSION_ID
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### XML Features

**No builds found**
- Verify `POB_DIRECTORY` is correct and contains `.xml` files
- Check file permissions

**Parse errors**
- Open the build in PoB GUI to verify it isn't corrupted
- Ensure PoB is up to date

### Lua Bridge

**`luajit command not found`**
```bash
brew install luajit          # macOS
sudo apt-get install luajit  # Ubuntu/Debian
```
Or set `POB_CMD` to the full path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/luajit`).

**`Failed to find valid ready banner`**
`POB_PATH` must point to the directory containing `HeadlessWrapper.lua`:
```bash
ls "$POB_PATH/HeadlessWrapper.lua"   # must exist
ls "$POB_PATH/Modules/"              # must exist
```

**`Timed out waiting for response`**
- Increase `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` (try `20000`)
- Test manually: `cd "$POB_PATH" && luajit HeadlessWrapper.lua`

**Stats don't match PoB GUI**
- Check bandit/pantheon/enemy settings with `get_config`
- Ensure the correct tree spec is active in the XML
- Make sure your PathOfBuilding checkout is up to date

**Bridge becomes unresponsive**
```
lua_stop → wait a moment → lua_start
```
If still unresponsive, restart Claude Desktop.

**Nodes dropped after `lua_set_tree`**
Nodes must form a valid connected path from the class starting node. Disconnected nodes are silently dropped by PoB. Ensure all intermediate nodes are included.

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # compile TypeScript
npm run dev     # watch mode
```

## Path of Building XML Structure

PoB builds are XML files with:
- `<Build>`: Character info and stats
- `<Tree>`: Passive skill tree node allocations
- `<Skills>`: Socket groups and gem links
- `<Items>`: Equipped items
- `<Notes>`: Build notes
